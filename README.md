Binary Hypothesis Testing Problem in White Gaussian Noise

Course: EE623A: Detection and Estimation Theory
– Considered 2 hypothesis with certain parameters, derived optimum test in the form of sufficient statistic, theoretically
calculated probability of false alarm and probability of detection with different energy level, also plotted ROC.
– Simulated probability of false alarm vs energy and probability of detection vs energy, simulated ROC for various energy
levels. Simulated results followed theoretical results.
